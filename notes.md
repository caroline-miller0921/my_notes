# My DS Notes

This is a repository for my notes

I learned the following about Git today:
    add the file using "git add" + file_name
    commit the file using "git commit -m" then providing an explanation of what you are uploading
    push the file using "git push"
    Creating a repository by creating it on Github first, then importing the clone ("git clone" + github link) onto the terminal using the link github generates
    "git log" will tell you your commits
    "git diff" will display the differences in versions as you save changes to your files
    "git status" will show you if you have any files committed
